# SuperFoodsMax Customer Analysis Project

This repository contains a comprehensive customer analysis project for SuperFoodsMax, conducted using Python. The project explores customer demographics, spending trends, and purchasing patterns to provide actionable insights for the business. This project is intended to provide potential employers with a clear understanding of my capabilities and experience in data analytics.

## Project Overview

This project consists of a series of Jupyter Notebooks that build upon each other to provide a holistic view of SuperFoodsMax customers. The notebooks cover data cleaning, demographic analysis, spending trend analysis, and product preference analysis for both loyal and first-time customers.

The project is structured as follows:

1.  **Data Cleaning:**
    * `1.SuperFoodsMax_cleaning.ipynb`: Initial data cleaning and preprocessing.

2.  **Loyalist Customer Analysis:**
    * `2.Loyalist Demographic.ipynb`: Analysis of loyal customer demographics.
    * `3.Loyalist Spending Trends.ipynb`: Examination of spending trends among loyal customers.
    * `4.Loyal Top 10 dept & commo.ipynb`: Identification of the top 10 departments and commodities preferred by loyal customers.

3.  **First-Time Customer Analysis:**
    * `5.First Time Demographic.ipynb`: Analysis of first-time customer demographics.
    * `6.First Time Spending Trends.ipynb`: Examination of spending trends among first-time customers.
    * `7.First Time Top 10 dept & commo.ipynb`: Identification of the top 10 departments and commodities preferred by first-time customers.

4.  **Specialized Analysis:**
    * `8.Essential Single Parent Products.ipynb`: Identification of essential products for single-parent households.
    * `9.Non meat comm in meat baskets.ipynb`: Analysis of non-meat commodities included in meat baskets.
